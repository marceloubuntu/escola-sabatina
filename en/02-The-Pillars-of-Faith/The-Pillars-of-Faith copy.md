#Introduction

The church is the place where members of the body of Christ are to be loved, preserved from false doctrines or teachings; it must also strengthen them in faith and word, growing in the knowledge of the Bible as the truth and the source of spiritual knowledge.

It also needs to supply the members' need for training in the service of Christ: to go in search of the souls for whom Jesus died and to make these people disciples or students of the school of Christ, teaching them to keep all the things that Jesus taught and has us taught.

In order for Christ's purpose for the church to be fulfilled, we have the lessons of the Bible school. The goal is to prepare students to be firm in Christ, knowing how to defend their beliefs through the word, the Bible, just as Jesus refuted and overcame the very enemy of souls, Satan, with a * "is written". * The Bible is ours rule of faith and practice for this life and for the preparation of eternal life in the company of angels who are in the holy presence of God.

We pray that our eternal Father can fulfill this purpose in his life and that these studies will become a means to help him in this purpose in Christ Jesus. Amen.

** Bible lesson instructions: **

Before beginning your lesson, we suggest that you pray for the enlightenment of the Spirit of God to enable you to understand, understand, the biblical truths to be studied each day. We also suggest that the lessons be done early in the morning, in the early hours of the day, so that the brother can put into practice what he learned in the day ahead, whether in making small or big daily decisions.

Most of the biblical passages are already in the lesson in order to avoid difficulties with translations, but it is always good to check your own Bible and make sure you understand the subject in theory. After reading and understanding the verses well, you will have three types of questions. The first type is an alternative, mark X, you must choose the only correct answer in the question and mark it as requested. The second type of question is true and false, you must put the question in front of it if it is true or if it is false. In the third type, you should list the issues, as stated.

We also suggest that biblical texts that are only quoted should be searched for and studied in your Bible. At the end of each lesson there will be an appeal for the brother to make a decision regarding the study carried out in which the brother must fill in yes or no. In case of doubts, clarifications and / or suggestions, we leave a space at the end of each lesson for the brother to fill in if he wishes. We pray that the Lord Jesus will bless and assist him in this Christian journey.

Kind regards,

Fourth Angel Ministry - Final Warning

# (1) The Gospel in Symbols

!!! quote Back Ground
    ** And they will make me a sanctuary, so that I can dwell among them. ** {class = verse} ** Exodus 25: 8 ** {class = book}

## Sunday

God desires His people, who are alive in the final moment of the history of this world, to know the special or fundamental truths that will help them to know the time and the events that surround them and their relationship with the purposes of God.

The knowledge of the truth and the application of these truths in our lives will make us living witnesses to preach and proclaim the last warning; the FINAL WARNING to the inhabitants of the Earth so that they can make their decision beside God or beside the enemy of God and the souls for whom Jesus died.

Almost two thousand years ago, when Christ walked among men, some accepted him as the prophet and the coming messiah; others saw Him as a new teacher among them; still others like a good man. However, some of them, when they heard about Jesus, were not content with what they said about Him or with His public teachings, but they wanted and felt the need for more time with Him alone; they recognized Him as Savior and Lord and therefore wanted to know where He lived. They stayed with Him in His house. ** John 1: 35-39. ** {class = book}

Even when Jesus taught the crowds; then in particular, some more intimately asked and had greater understanding, these were known as the twelve apostles and even among the apostles there was a smaller group that accompanied Jesus in special situations. Finally, the Bible speaks of the beloved disciple John, who of the twelve was the Master's closest. This John was given a special insight into the Savior, as we can see in the gospel he wrote, as in his letters filled with love for his brothers. John was also given the Apocalypse, the revelation of things that were soon to happen.

As a people, we must know the truths for the end time, but as individuals we can maintain a more intimate relationship with Jesus in order to reveal to the world the power of God that is manifested by Christ living in us.

** What will God's peculiar people be like on Earth just before Jesus returns? ** {class = question} ** Revelation 14: 1,4,5 ** {class = bookQ}  
** I looked, and, behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having written on his forehead his name and the name of his Father. These are the ones who have not been defiled with women, because they are chaste. They are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They are those who have been redeemed from among men, first fruits to God and to the Lamb; and no mistake was found in his mouth; they have no blemish. ** {class = versoQ} ** Revelation 14: 1,4,5 ** {class = bookVerse}

** Mark statements with V when true and F when false. **

a) () The people of God who will live in the last days will be a holy people, that is, separated from the corruption of the world.  
b) () They will be living witnesses of God's transforming power.  
c) () They will have no doctrine or teaching other than those in the Bible.  
d) () They will be extremely strange and different from Jesus.  

## Monday

We saw in the book of Revelation that the people of God in this time in which we live, which the Bible calls the end time, have not been contaminated with "women" because they are chaste and follow the Lamb wherever they go.

** What does the symbol * "woman" * represent in the prophecy? ** {class = question} ** Ephesians 5: 22-25 ** {class = bookQ}

## Wednesday

** The Sanctuary - The Gospel in symbols **

The Israelites were God's people when they left Egypt. They had been there as slaves for four hundred and thirty years and had lost much of the knowledge of the God who created us. As slaves they had no way to worship and serve their God, and now as they left by the power manifested by the Great God, they were to learn or relearn much of the worship, gratitude and praise of the one true God. It was God's purpose to be revealed to all people through the love, mercy, kindness and knowledge of Himself manifested to the people of Israel. An order was communicated to Moses, while on the mountain with God ...

** What did God command the people of Israel through Moses? ** {class = question} ** Exodus 25: 8,9,40 ** {class = bookQ}  
** And they will make me a sanctuary, so that I can live among them. According to all that I show you for the model of the tabernacle and for the model of all its furniture, you will still do it. See, therefore, that everything does according to the model shown to you on the mountain. ** {class = versoQ} ** Exodus 25: 8,9,40 ** {class = bookVerse}

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) God ordered Moses to have a big party.   
b) God ordered Moses to make a place for His habitation. He showed Moses the model - the sanctuary of heaven to make a copy of it here on Earth.   
c) God ordered the people to go to church, because there and only there would He be with His people.   

!!! note ""
	Because of their apostasy, the Israelites were stripped of the blessing of the divine presence, and for some time made it impossible for them to establish a sanctuary for God. But, after having been received again in Heaven's favor, the great chief proceeded to carry out the divine order. The sanctuary was a collapsible tent made up of several covers. It contained a courtyard and a tent itself with two compartments: the holy place and the most holy place which were separated by a veil. Each compartment had specific furniture to teach about the work of Christ's redemption and salvation for us.

** How and where is the model shown to Moses on the mount so that he could do the same? ** {class = question} ** Hebrews 9:24 ** {class = bookQ}  
** Because Christ did not enter a sanctuary made by hands, a figure of the true, but in the same heaven, to now appear for us, before the face of God. ** {class = versoQ} ** Hebrews 9:24 ** {class = bookVerse}

b) The copy of the sanctuary was not made by human hands and is found in Egypt.   
c) The true sanctuary is found in heaven and was not made by human hands.

** And he put the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered a burnt offering and a food offering on it, as the LORD commanded Moses. He also placed the sink between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water to wash in it. And Moses and Aaron and their sons washed their hands and feet in it. When they entered the tent of meeting, and when they reached the altar, they washed, as the Lord had commanded Moses. He also raised the courtyard around the tabernacle and the altar, and hung the curtain on the courtyard door. So Moses finished the work. ** {class = versoQ} ** Exodus 40: 29-33 ** {class = bookVerse}

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) Flowers, animals and a fountain.   
b) Sacrifice altar, washbasin or sink.   
c) Many banks for the people to settle.   

!!! note ""
	The altar of the burnt offering or sacrifice, which was very close to the entrance to the courtyard, represented or pointed to the great sacrifice of the cross on Calvary where Jesus, the true Lamb of God, died in our place. There the repentant sinner appeared, taking an animal as his substitute, or to take the sinner's place; guided by the priests of the plan of salvation, the sinner placed his hand on the victim's head and killed him. Our sins killed the Son of God. Then the priest took the victim's blood and placed it on the altar and sprinkled it on the veil. Sin was recorded in the sanctuary and the sinner was forgiven. The sink or basin was where the priest was to wash his hands and feet whenever he entered the sacred compartments or approached the altar to offer a burnt offering to the Lord. After the animal was sacrificed in its place, the sinner was replaced by the priest who officiated in his favor in the sanctuary. Where the sinner could not enter. It was washed and cleaned by the water in the sink, just as Christ cleanses and purifies us by the Word applied to our life experience.

** In addition to the courtyard, how many parts were there in this sanctuary? ** {class = question} ** Hebrews 9: 2,3 ** {class = bookQ}  
** In effect, the tabernacle was prepared, whose front part, where the lamp was, and the table, and the exhibition of the loaves, is called the Holy Place; behind the second veil was the tabernacle called the Holy of Holies ** {class = versoQ} ** Hebrews 9: 2,3 ** {class = bookVerse}

** What was in the holy place? ** {class = question} ** Exodus 40: 22-26 ** {class = bookQ}   
** He also set the table in the tabernacle of the congregation, beside the tabernacle, to the north, outside the veil, And on it he set the bread in order before the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses. He also placed the lampstand in front of the table, next to the tabernacle, to the south in the congregation tent, and lit the lamps before the LORD, as the LORD had commanded Moses. And he placed the golden altar in the tent of meeting, before the veil. ** {class = versoQ} ** Exodus 40: 22-26 ** {class = bookVerse}

b) A beautiful golden altar.   
c) Table of bread, candlestick, and before the veil the golden altar.   

! [] (O-Santuario-Lugar-Santo.png)

The three pieces of furniture that were in the Holy Place, as we saw were:

a) The lamp or candlestick that served to illuminate the Sanctuary, just as Christ is the Light of the world; Christians are called to be light, to be like Jesus in this world, drawing people to Christ.

b) Table of the proposition loaves that point to Jesus, the true Bread from heaven that feeds us and gives us eternal life; freeing us from sin.

c) Altar of incense that points to Christ Jesus, the only mediator between God and the sinner. This piece of furniture was closer to the Ark of the Covenant and this is to remind us that through prayer we get closer to God. Precisely, before the veil that separated the holy from the most holy place and the immediate presence of God, was the golden altar of incense. On this altar the priest was to burn incense every morning and every afternoon; its ends were touched with the blood of the sin offering, and it was sprinkled with blood on the great day of atonement. The fire on this altar had been kindled by God himself, and kept in a sacred manner. The fragrance of holy incense was diffused through the sanctuary compartments and even outside, in the distance, its soft fragrance could be felt.

## Saturday

** To study and meditate with family: **

The sanctuary referred to by the apostle Paul in Hebrews was the one built by Moses, by order of God, while the Israelites traveled through the desert. It was built in a way that could be taken from place to place. In addition to the outer courtyard, where the altar of burnt offerings was; the tabernacle contained two compartments called holy and most holy; separated by a rich and beautiful curtain or veil identical to the one that closed the entrance to the first compartment.

In the holy place was the table with the presence breads on one side and, on the south side, the candlestick with seven lamps illuminating the sanctuary day and night; and before the veil that separated the holy place from the most holy place was the golden altar for incense, from which the fragrant cloud, with the prayers of Israel, ascended daily to the presence of God. In the most holy place was the gold-covered ark and depository of the stone tablets on which God had inscribed the law of the Ten Commandments.

Above the ark forming the cover of this sacred receptacle was the mercy seat, topped by two cherubs, one on each side, all worked in solid gold. In this place the divine presence was manifested in the cloud of glory among the cherubim. When the Hebrews settled in Canaan, the tabernacle was replaced by the temple of Solomon, a permanent structure that kept the same proportions and was similarly manned. In this form the sanctuary existed until its destruction by the Romans, in the year 70 of our era, except in the time when it was in ruins during the time of Daniel.

** Is this earthly sanctuary still in force today after the death of Jesus Christ? ** {class = question} ** Matthew 27: 50,51 ** {class = bookQ}  
** And Jesus, crying out again with a loud voice, surrendered the spirit. And behold, the veil of the temple was rent in two from top to bottom; and the earth shook, and the stones split; ** {class = versoQ} ** Matthew 27: 50,51 ** {class = bookVerse}

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) Yes in every church that exists.   
b) No, its validity was until the death of the true Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world, Jesus.   
c) Yes, he is still in Jerusalem today and if I want to be forgiven of my sins, I have to go there.

# (2) The Heavenly Sanctuary - The Temple of God in Heaven

!!! quote Golden Back
	Because Christ did not enter into a sanctuary made by hands, a figure of the true, but in the same heaven, to appear, now, for us, before God; ** Hebrews 9:24 ** {class = book}

## Sunday

The Bible reports the existence of another sanctuary, which actually already existed in heaven, which God Himself showed Moses when he ordered him to build a sanctuary according to the model he was shown. ** Now the sum of what we have said is that we have such a priest, who is seated in Heaven at the right hand of the throne of Majesty, minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord founded, and not man. ** {class = verse} ** Hebrews 8: 1,2 ** {class = book}

This is revealed as the sanctuary of the new concert. The sanctuary of the first concert was built by man, built by Moses. The latter was built by the Lord and not by man. When the apostle John received the vision of Revelation, he contemplated the heavenly sanctuary, as we can see from the compartments and furniture that are reported ...

** What did John see in Heaven? ** {class = question} ** Revelation 11:19; 15: 8 ** {class = bookQ}

## Wednesday

Precisely before the veil that separated the holy from the most holy place and the immediate presence of God, the golden altar of incense was found. On this altar the priest was to burn incense every morning and evening, its ends were touched with the blood of the sin offering, and it was sprinkled with blood on the great day of atonement.

## Thursday

The incomparable splendor of the earthly tabernacle reflected in human sight the glories of the heavenly temple in which Christ, our Precursor, ministered for us before God. The abode of the King of kings, where thousands of thousands serve Him, and millions of millions are standing before Him, yes, that temple, filled with glory from the eternal throne, where seraphim, his shining guards, veil their faces in worship - he could not find in the most wonderful structure that human hands could erect, but a pale reflection of his greatness and glory. However, important truths concerning the heavenly sanctuary and the great work carried out there by the redemption of man, were taught by the earthly sanctuary and its worship.

Read carefully and observe the place of the heavenly sanctuary, where the following biblical passages refer:  
** And from the throne came lightning, and thunder, and voices; and seven lamps of fire burned before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God. ** {class = versoQ} ** Revelation 4: 5 ** {class = bookVerse}  
** And another angel came and stood by the altar, having a golden censer; and he was given much incense, to put it with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar, which is before the throne. ** {class = versoQ} ** Revelation 8: 3 ** {class = bookVerse}

** Tick the correct answer: **

b) It refers to the most holy place.   
c) Refers to the courtyard of the earthly sanctuary.   

!!! note ""
	 In the heavenly temple, God's abode, is His throne, established in justice and judgment. In the most holy place is His law, the great rule of justice, by which all humanity is tested. The ark that encloses the tablets of the law is covered by the mercy seat, before which Christ, by His blood, pleads for the sinner. This is how the union of justice and mercy in the plan of human redemption is represented. Only infinite wisdom could conceive of this union, and infinite power to achieve it; it is a union that fills all heaven with admiration and adoration.

## Friday

The cherubs of the earthly sanctuary, looking reverently at the mercy seat, represent the interest with which the heavenly host contemplates the work of redemption. This is the mystery of mercy that the angels wish to attend to: that God can be just, while justifying the repentant sinner and renewing His relations with the fallen race; that Christ can humble himself in order to raise up innumerable multitudes from the abyss of ruin and to dress them in immaculate garments of His own righteousness, in order to unite with the angels that never fell and dwell forever in the presence of God.

Notice how the prophet Zechariah presents the work of Christ as man's intercessor in this prophecy. 
** ... Here is the man whose name is Renovo; it will spring from its place and build the temple of the Lord. He himself will build the temple of the Lord, and bring glory, and sit down, and rule on his throne, and be a priest on his throne, and the peace council will be between them. ** {class = verse} * * Zechariah 6: 12,13 ** {class = book}  

** Mark statements with V when true and F when false. **  
a) () He himself will build the temple of the Lord.   
b) () By His sacrifice and mediation, Christ is the foundation and builder of the church of God.   
c) () To Christ belongs the glory of the redemption of the fallen race.   
d) () Christ is both King and Priest.   
e) () Christ is going to build the temple that was destroyed in Jerusalem.   

!!! note ""
	And he will sit and rule on His throne, and be a priest on His throne. Today, Christ is still not on the throne of His glory; this kingdom is not open. Only after He finishes His work as mediator, God the Father, will He give Him the throne of David, which this reign will have no end (** Luke 1: 32,33 ** {class = book}). As a priest, Christ is now seated with the Father on His throne (** Revelation 3:21 ** {class = book}). Christ presents the intercession of a hereditary and broken body, of an immaculate life. The manos heridas, the perforated side, the studded pieces, pleaded for the fallen man, whose redemption was committed to an infinite price.

And the peace council will be between them both. The Father's love, no less than the Son's love, is the foundation of salvation for the lost race.

# (3) The Purification of the Sanctuary

!!! quote Back Ground
    But in the second, the high priest, he alone, once a year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of ignorance of the people. ** Hebrews 9: 7 ** {class = book}

## Sunday

The Bible makes reference in the book of the prophet Daniel, to a sanctuary that should be purified ** And he said to me: Until two thousand three hundred afternoons and mornings; and the sanctuary will be purified ** {class = verse} ** Daniel 8:14 ** {class = book}. It could not be the tabernacle that was built by Moses; for in Daniel's time it was no more, and the angel also spoke to the prophet and said: ** Understand, son of man, because this vision will come true in the end time ** {class = verse} ** Daniel 8:17 ** {class = book}.

So a time far ahead of the prophet Daniel's day. The term sanctuary in the Bible refers primarily to the earthly tabernacle built by Moses, as a model for heavenly things; and, second, to the real tabernacle in heaven, to which the sanctuary pointed. At the death of Christ, the typical service ended. The * "true tabernacle" * in Heaven is the sanctuary of the covenant, and must be the one that should be purified, according to the angel's words.

An important question comes to mind: What is the cleansing of the sanctuary?

We learn about purification in the book of Hebrews, chapter 9.

** "Almost all things, according to the law, are purified with blood; and without bloodshed there is no remission, or purging of sin. So it was very necessary for the figures of things in Heaven to be purified like this [ with animal blood], but heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these "** {class = verse}, that is, with the precious blood of Christ.

The ministry of the earthly sanctuary consisted of two parts: the priests ministered daily in the holy place, while once a year the high priest performed a special work of atonement in the most holy place, for the purification of the sanctuary. Day after day the repentant sinner took his offering to the door of the tabernacle and, placing his hand on the victim's head, confessed his sins, thus transferring them in a figure of himself to the innocent sacrifice. The animal was then killed. * "Without bloodshed" *, says the apostle, there is no remission of sin. ** The life of the flesh is in your blood. ** {class = versoQ} ** Leviticus 17:11 ** {class = bookVerse}  

** When the sin offering was made, what was done with the blood of the offering? ** {class = question} ** Leviticus 4: 17,30 ** {class = bookQ}  
** He will dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, before the veil. ** {class = versoQ} ** Leviticus 4:17 ** {class = bookVerse}  
** Then the priest, with his finger, will take the blood of the offering and place it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering; and all the rest of the blood will spill at the base of the altar. ** {class = versoQ} ** Leviticus 4:30 ** {class = bookVerse}  

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) The blood of the offering was shed at the feet of the repentant sinner.   
b) The blood of the offering was placed by the priest on the ends or horns of the altar and the rest was spilled at the base of the altar in the case of individual sin. When this was committed by the priest or by the whole congregation, the blood was sprinkled on the veil, remaining as a record of sin until the day of the sanctuary's purification.   
c) The blood was sprinkled on the lamb.   

!!! note ""
	 After the person discovered his sin by the law that required the death of the offender, he first brought his offering, confessed his sin while keeping his hands on the victim, and thus, in figure, transferred his sin to the victim; it was then killed in the courtyard, or outside the sanctuary, and its blood was put on the ends of the altar and spilled at its base. Through this procedure, sins were forgiven and, in typical service, transferred to the sanctuary.

** Is there also a record of our sins in heaven? ** {class = question} ** Isaiah 65: 6,7 ** {class = bookQ}  
** Behold, it is written before me, and I will not be silent; but I will pay, I will take full revenge on your iniquities and, together, your parents' iniquities, says the LORD ... ** {class = versoQ} ** Isaiah 65: 6,7 ** {class = bookVerse}  

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) Yes, just as in the sanctuary of the earth, when we for the merits of Christ repent of our sins He forgives us, but a record of our sins remains in heaven.   
b) No, when we ask for forgiveness for our sins, God blots them out as if they never existed.   
c) No, there is no sanctuary in heaven.   

!!! note ""

## Monday

This was the work that continued, day after day, throughout the year. Israel's sins were thus transferred to the sanctuary, and a special work became imperative for their removal.

!!! note ""
	 The High Priest was forbidden to enter the most sacred compartment of the sanctuary (Santíssimo) every day. The only day in the whole year that he could enter this place was the day of atonement. The atonement ceremony was held at the Blessed Sacrament.

** How would the sanctuary be purified and what would finally happen with the sins of the people deposited there? ** {class = question} ** Leviticus 16: 9,10 ** {class = bookQ}  
** Aaron will bring the goat on which the lot falls for the Lord to come and offer it as a sin offering.

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) Two goats were brought before the High Priest. Luck was being cast on both. One was chosen to be sacrificed for the cleansing of the people's sins, while the other remained alive and received all the sins upon him. Thus the Sanctuary was cleansed from the people's sins.   
b) The Sanctuary was washed with water by the Levites. Thus the Sanctuary was cleansed from the people's sins.   
c) The Sanctuary was replaced. So the Sanctuary was clean   
of the people's sins.

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) The goat's blood was thrown away, since it was full of the people's sins.   
b) The goat's blood was taken to the Most Holy to be offered as an atonement for the sins of all the people. In the same way, Christ, entering the heavenly sanctuary, entered not with goat's blood, but with His own blood. (See also: ** Hebrews 9: 11-13 ** {class = book})   
c) The goat's blood was spilled on the burnt altar in the sanctuary's atrium.

## Wednesday

Important truths concerning the atonement were taught by the typical service:

1. A substitute was accepted in place of the sinner.
2. However, sin was not canceled by the victim's blood.
3. This provided a means by which he was transferred to the sanctuary.
4. By offering the blood, the sinner recognized the authority of the law.
5. Confessed his guilt in the transgression and expressed his desire for forgiveness through faith in the coming Redeemer.
6. But he was not yet entirely free from the condemnation of the law.
7. On the day of atonement, the high priest took an offering from the congregation.
8. He entered the most holy place with the blood of that offering and sprinkled it on the mercy seat, directly on the law, satisfying his demands.
9. As a mediator, the high priest took sins upon himself and removed them from the sanctuary.
10. Placing his hands on the scapegoat's head, he confessed all these sins, transferring them figuratively from himself to the goat.
11. The goat carried away sins and thus were considered to be separated from the people forever.

!!! note ""
	 Throughout the year, the priestly ministry in the first compartment of the sanctuary, inside the veil that constituted the door and separated the holy place from the outer courtyard, represents the work of ministry which Christ initiated by ascending to Heaven. It was the work of the priest in the daily ministry, to present before God the blood of the sin offering, as well as the incense that ascended with Israel's prayers. It was done all year round. Thus pleads Christ before the Father and through His blood for sinners, and presents before Him also, with the precious fragrance of His own righteousness, the prayers of repentant believers. This was the work of ministry in the first compartment of the heavenly sanctuary .

The disciples' faith accompanied Jesus when He ascended to Heaven before his eyes. His hopes were then centered there, as the apostle Paul says: ** Which we have as an anchor of the soul, safe and firm, and which penetrates into the veil, Where Jesus, our forerunner, entered for us, made eternally high priest , according to the order of Melchizedek. Not by the blood of goats and calves but by His own blood, He entered the sanctuary once, having accomplished an eternal redemption. ** {class = versoQ} ** Hebrews 6: 19,20; 9:12 ** {class = bookVerse}

## Saturday

** To meditate and study with the family. **

For more than eighteen centuries Jesus did the work of offering His blood for the repentant believer; assured them of forgiveness and acceptance before the Father; however, their sins still remain in the record books. Just as in the typical service there was a work of atonement at the close of each year, so, before Christ's work for man's redemption is completed, there is also a work of atonement to remove sin from the sanctuary. This is the service started when the 2300 days are over. At that time our High Priest entered the most holy place to carry out the last phase of His solemn work - to purify the sanctuary. This real purification of the heavenly sanctuary must be effected by removing, or blotting out, the sins that are recorded there.

But before this is accomplished, there must be an examination of the record books to determine who, through repentance for sins and faith in Christ, is entitled to the benefits of His atonement. The cleansing of the sanctuary therefore involves an investigation - a trial. This work must be done before the coming of Christ to rescue His people, since when He comes He will bring His reward in order to give to each according to their works.

** And Aaron (the high priest) will lay his hands on the head of the living goat, and will confess all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, according to all their sins; and he will put them on the goat's head, and send him into the desert by the hand of a man appointed for that. So that goat will take their iniquities to the lonely land ** {class = verse} (** Leviticus 16: 21,22 ** {class = book}). The scapegoat was no longer coming to Israel's camp, and the man who had taken him was required to wash himself and his clothes with water before returning to the camp.

This whole ceremony was intended to impress the Israelites with the holiness of God and His horror of sin; and too much, to show them that they could not come into contact with sin without being polluted. It was demanded that while the work of atonement was carried out, all occupations were put aside, and the entire congregation of Israel was to spend the day in solemn humiliation before God, with prayer, fasting and a deep examination of the heart.

# (4) The 2300 Afternoon and Morning Prophecy

!!! quote Back Ground
    He said to me: Up to two thousand three hundred afternoons and mornings; and the sanctuary will be purified. ** Daniel 8:14 ** {class = book}

## Sunday

God had established in advance in His prophetic calendar a date when the work of purification of the same would begin in the heavenly sanctuary.
Daniel, who lived most of his life in Babylon, after being deported there around 606 BC was revealed the date that the * "Purification of the Sanctuary" * would begin. Daniel tells us in the book that bears his name, in chapter 9: 1,2 of Scripture, that studying the books of the prophet Jeremiah came to the conclusion that the years of the captivity of his people were near the end and therefore he began to pray to God about it. This was the first year of King Darius, 538 BC The years of desolation, according to the prophet Jeremiah, should have been 70 years; therefore, the restoration was approximately two years away ...

** As the time of release from captivity approached, what did Daniel do then? ** {class = question} ** Daniel 9: 3 ** {class = bookQ}  
** And I turned my face to the Lord God, to seek him with prayer and supplication, with fasting, and sack and ash. ** {class = versoQ} ** Daniel 9: 3 ** {class = bookVerse}

a) He started to move people to leave for Jerusalem.   
b) He began to pray and plead with God.   
c) He stopped working, as he was already at the end of his captivity.   

** What was the prophet especially interested in? ** {class = question} ** Daniel 9:17 ** {class = bookQ}  
** Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of your servant, and his supplications, and make your face shine for your sake over your devastated sanctuary. ** {class = versoQ} ** Daniel 9 : 17 ** {class = bookVerse}  

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) That the sanctuary of God in Jerusalem that was devastated be restored.   
b) May the face of God shine upon him again.   
c) That God's people were sent back to Jerusalem.   

** When Daniel finished the prayer, Gabriel arrived and gave him a certainty, what was that certainty? ** {class = question} ** Daniel 9: 21-23 ** {class = bookQ}  
** While I say, still speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in my vision at the beginning, came, flying quickly, and touched me, at the hour of the afternoon sacrifice. He instructed me, and spoke to me, saying: Daniel, now I have come out to make you understand the meaning. At the beginning of your supplications, the order came out, and I came to declare it, because you are very loved; therefore consider the word, and understand the vision. ** {class = versoQ} ** Daniel 9: 21-23 ** {class = bookVerse}  

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) As for the time of the people's departure back to their homeland.   
b) The angel wanted to make Daniel understand the meaning of the vision.   
c) That Daniel was very dear to God.   

** What earlier instruction, related to Daniel 8's vision, was thus being more widely carried out? ** {class = question} ** Daniel 8: 14-16 ** {class = bookQ}  
** And he said to me: Up to two thousand three hundred afternoons and mornings; and the sanctuary will be purified. And it came to pass that, when I, Daniel, had the vision, I sought the meaning, and, behold, it appeared before me as if it were a likeness of a man. And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, who shouted, and said: Gabriel, make this vision understand. ** {class = versoQ} ** Daniel 8: 14-16 ** {class = bookVerse }  

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) The sight of monstrous animals.   
b) The vision of the sanctuary to be purified.   
c) The vision of the end of the world.   

** Why were further instructions needed regarding this view? ** {class = question} ** Daniel 8:27 ** {class = bookQ}  
** And I, Daniel, weakened, and I was sick for a few days; so I got up and went about the king's business. And I was amazed about the vision, and there was no one who understood it. ** {class = versoQ} ** Daniel 8:27 ** {class = bookVerse}  

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) Because nobody knew how to understand the vision, and Daniel was amazed by it.   
b) So that Daniel could explain to the people, when he asked.   
c) To make it clearer what God wanted Daniel to do.   

** Gabriel directed Daniel's attention to the subject that concerned him. What was this subject? ** {class = question} ** Daniel 9:23 ** {class = bookQ}  
** At the beginning of your supplications, the order came out, and I came to declare it, because you are very loved; therefore consider the word, and understand the vision. ** {class = versoQ} ** Daniel 9:23 ** {class = bookVerse}  

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) The subject that concerned Daniel was the return of the people of Israel to their land.   
b) What concerned Daniel was the sight of the devastated sanctuary and the angel's words that it would take 2300 afternoons and mornings for him to be cleansed.   
c) Daniel was not worried about anything.   

!!! note ""
	 Many facts confirm to us that the instructions contained in the ninth chapter of Daniel supplement and interpret the vision of the eighth chapter:

1. Daniel did not understand the vision about his people and the sanctuary being trampled underfoot, so he investigated the prophecies about the captivity period again.
2. Certainly he established a relationship between the period of seventy years mentioned by Jeremiah, and the two thousand and three hundred days of the vision, and immediately began to pray with all fervor for the restoration of the city and the sanctuary.
3. The angel Gabriel, who appeared to him at the beginning and interpreted all the vision except the two thousand and three hundred days, now presents himself to him, and directs his attention to the vision.
4. The events of the vision begin with the kingdom of the Medes and Persians, the time of the restoration of the Jews to their own land. In the absence of any instructions to the contrary, this would be the natural time in which the beginning of the two thousand and three hundred day period must be located; and this is precisely the time shown for the beginning of the seventy weeks, which are clearly a part of the 2300 days, and thus determine the time of its beginning.
5. The seventy weeks, or four hundred and ninety days, extend from the restoration of Jerusalem and the literal temple, to the preaching of the gospel to everyone.

	 According to history, the order of King Artaxerxes for the people of Israel to return to their land was promulgated in 457 BC Now we have the departure date for the 2300-year count.
Let's see when the 2300 years ended:
With the starting date of the year 457 BC, we see the following:

`2300 - 457 = 1843`

As there was no year "0" in the story count, that is, from year 1 BC we went straight to year 1 AD, we must add another year in the count so that we have the correct date:

`1843 + 1 = 1844 AD`

## Thursday

In 1844 began the purification of the Sanctuary of heaven, the judgment and the restoration of the truth on Earth.

Let's take the real proof of the prophecy:

a) After 7 weeks and 62 weeks (`69 x 7 = 483 years`) the Messiah would come:` 483-456 = 27 AD`   
The word Messiah means anointed. The year when Jesus was anointed or baptized with the Spirit was exactly the year `27 AD` (** Matthew 3:16; Acts 10:38 ** {class = book})  
b) In the middle of the last 70 weeks the Messiah would be killed (see ** Daniel 9: 26-27 ** {class = book}): Exactly 3 ½ years after Jesus' baptism (between March and April of the year 31 AD). The prophecy was confirmed (see ** Daniel 9:24 ** {class = book}).   
c) At the end of 70 weeks Stephen was killed and the apostle Paul was converted, from then on the Gospel was taken to the Gentiles (see ** Acts 7: 58-59; 8: 1-5; 9: 15 * * {class = book}).   

!!! note ""
	 Like the part of the great prophetic period pointed out by the angel that would be set apart for Daniel's people, the Jews; if it was fulfilled with mathematical precision, we can be sure that the rest of the period that points to the final fulfillment of the prophecy will also be fulfilled in the same way.  
	 
	 The visible part of the fulfilled prophecy casts credibility as to the interpretation of the prophecy and the real fulfillment of the part that remains to be fulfilled, although we cannot see what happened in Heaven on the date indicated by the prophecy (10/22/1844); we are confident that on this date Jesus and His Father in the presence of the angels initiated the investigative judgment to analyze the case of each one who accepted Jesus as their Savior and Lord.  
	 
	 And as soon as this judgment is concluded, determining who is entitled to the benefits that Jesus came to grant, staying in Him and living His life here. Jesus will come to seek those who await him for salvation.

** What did the angel say would happen to the people of Israel until the end time? ** {class = question} ** Daniel 9:26 ** {class = bookQ}  
** After the sixty-two weeks, the Anointed One will be killed and will no longer be; and the people of a prince to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary, and their end will be in a flood, and until the end there will be war; desolations are determined. ** {class = versoQ} ** Daniel 9:26 ** {class = bookVerse}  

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) God wrote that after killing the Messiah, there would never be peace in Israel again. We still see this nation constantly at war showing that prophecy is   
fulfilling itself.
b) The angel said nothing.   
c) I don't know, I didn't understand the prophecy.   

## Friday

To better understand what we have seen of the prophecy so far, follow the dates and periods by looking at the diagram below:

! [] (grafico-2300-anos-de-Daniel.png)

!!! note ""
	 In the year 1844 Jesus entered the Most Holy compartment of the Heavenly Sanctuary to begin the last work of intercession on behalf of His people.

The judgment is in progress, do you want to consecrate yourself to God today to be approved when your name is on the agenda? The angel stated that at the end of the period of 2300 prophetic days or literal years, at that time Christ's great work for the world, the atonement, or the investigative judgment would begin. The typical Day of Atonement for Israel took up only one day of the year. The investigative judgment may take a relatively short time. This work has been going on for more than a century, and will soon be completed. Who will be prepared for your decisions?

## Saturday

** To meditate and study with the family. **

While the sin offering pointed to Christ as a sacrifice, and the high priest represented Him as a mediator, the scapegoat typified Satan, the author of sin and upon whom the sins of true penitents will finally be placed. When at the end of the ceremony of atonement, the high priest placed sins on the head of the living goat that was taken tied to the desert and left there. So too when Christ, by virtue and merit of His own blood, removes the sins of His people from the heavenly sanctuary, at the close of His ministry, He will place the sins on Satan who, in the execution of the judgment, must bear the final penalty. The scapegoat was sent to an uninhabited land, never to return to the congregation of Israel. So Satan will forever be banished from the presence of God and His people,

He comes to the Elder of Days in Heaven to receive dominion, glory and kingdom, which will be given to him at the end of His work as a mediator. It was this coming and not His return to Earth, which was predicted in the prophecy to be fulfilled at the end of the 2300 days, in 1844. Assisted by the heavenly angels, our great High Priest enters the Most Holy Place and there he appears to the presence of God to engage in the last acts of His ministry on behalf of man to execute the Investigative Judgment and make atonement for all who are deemed worthy of receiving their benefits.

## Tuesday

In the typical service performed at the Israelites' sanctuary, only those who had appeared before God with confession and repentance, and whose transgressions, through the blood of the sin offering, were transferred to the sanctuary, had part in the service of the day of atonement. Thus, on the great final day of atonement before an investigative judgment, the only cases considered are those of the professed people of God.

** What are the books of judgment? ** {class = question}

** Mark statements with V when true and F when false: **

a) () Book of Life - It has the name of all those who entered the service of Christ. ** And I also ask you, my true companion, to help these women who worked with me in the gospel, and with Clement, and with the other co-workers, whose names are in the book of life. ** {class = versoQ} * * Philippians 624: 3 ** {class = book}   

b) () Memorial Book - Contains the record of the saints (see also ** Isaiah 65: 6,7 ** {class = book}). ** And I saw the dead, great and small, who were before God, and the books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by the things that were written in the books, according to their works. ** {class = versoQ} ** Revelation 20:12 ** {class = book}    

!!! note ""
	 The books of record in Heaven, in which the names and acts of men are inscribed, must determine the decisions of the Judgment. The prophet Daniel says: * "The court was set, and the books were opened." * John, the developer, describing the same scene, adds: ** Yet another book, the Book of Life, has been opened. And the dead were judged, according to works, according to what was written in the books. ** {class = verse} ** Revelation 20:12 ** {class = book}

The book of life contains the names of all those who entered the service of God, the only ones who will enter the city of God are those that are written in the Lamb's book of life.

In the memorial book, the good works of those who fear the Lord and for those who remember His name are recorded. Your words of faith and acts of love are placed there. Every temptation resisted, every evil overcome, every word of tender pity expressed, is faithfully recorded. Like every act of sacrifice, every suffering and sadness endured because of Christ is marked there. ** ... you collected my tears in your skin; Aren't they written in your book? ** {class = versoQ} ** Psalm 56: 8 ** {class = book}. ** Because God will bring all works to justice, even those that are hidden, whether good or bad ** {class = verse} ** Ecclesiastes 12; 14 ** {class = book}. ** I tell you that every frivolous word that men utter, they will account for on the Day of Judgment;

** When is someone's name written in the book of life? ** {class = question} ** John 5:24; Philippians 4: 3 ** {class = bookQ}
** Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life, does not enter into judgment, but has passed from death to life. ** {class = versoQ} ** John 5 : 24 ** {class = bookVerse}  
** To you, faithful companion of yoke, I also ask that you help them, because together they strove with me in the gospel, also with Clement and with the other co-workers of mine, whose names are in the Book of Life. ** Philippians 4: 3 ** {class = bookVerse}  

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) When we are born.   
b) When we enter the service of Christ   
c) When we are baptized.   

When we enter into the service of Christ, we become carriers of Eternal Life and our names are inscribed in the Book of Life.

** Who will be judged? ** {class = question} ** I Peter 4:17; II Corinthians 5:10 ** {class = bookQ}

** Because it is important that we all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive according to the good or evil he has done through the body. ** {class = versoQ} ** II Chronicles 5:10 ** { class = bookVerse}  

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) The people of Israel.   
b) All the inhabitants of the Earth.   
c) Those who accepted Jesus Christ.

	 In this court, the cases of all those who entered the service of Christ will be analyzed.

** Will those who do not believe in Jesus be judged in this court? ** {class = question} ** John 3: 18,19 ** {class = bookQ}  
** Whoever believes in him is not condemned; he who does not believe is already condemned, because he does not believe in the name of the only begotten Son of God. ** {class = versoQ} ** John 3: 18,19 ** {class = bookVerse}  

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) Yes b) No c) Only some of the wicked.   

!!! note ""
	 The salary of sin is death. Death passed to all men for that ... all sinned (** Romans 6; 23; 5:12 ** {class = book}). So, unless they submit to the spirit guide of Jesus, they are doomed. Therefore, they do not need to have their cases evaluated in the Investigative Judgment initiated in 1844. The Bible reveals that the case of the wicked will be dealt with on another occasion, at the end of the thousand years, after Jesus' coming.

## Wednesday

When the books of record at the Judgment are opened, the lives of all who believed in Jesus are reviewed before God. Starting with the first ones who lived on Earth, our Lawyer presents the cases of each successive generation, ending with the living. Every name is mentioned, every case thoroughly investigated. Names are accepted, and names are rejected. When someone has sins that remain in the record books, for which there was no repentance or forgiveness, their name will be omitted from the book of life, and the account of their good deeds will be erased from God's memorial book.

All those who have truly repented of sin and who, by faith, have claimed the blood of Jesus Christ as their atoning sacrifice, have had forgiveness added (I bet) to his name in the books of Heaven; as they become partakers of the righteousness of Christ, and if their character is found to be in harmony with the law of God, their sins will be blotted out and they themselves will be considered worthy of eternal life.

** How is the judgment made? ** {class = question} ** Revelation 20:12 ** {class = bookQ}  
** I also saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne. Then the books were opened. Yet another book, the Book of Life, was opened. And the dead were judged, according to their works, according to what was written in the books. ** {class = versoQ} ** Revelation 20:12 ** {class = bookVerse}  

** Mark statements with V when true and F when false. **

a) () First, the book of life opens. If the person’s name is there,   
b) () His record of sins is verified, if he has walked in accordance with the will of God.   
c) () If this person confessed his sins and accepted Jesus as his personal Savior and seeks to live a holy, sinless life in Christ Jesus, he will be saved.   
d) () You will then receive your reward based on the book of good works (memorial).   
e) () If this person does not live a life worthy of a Christian, he will receive a salary for his sin (death).   
f) () If the person's name is in the Book of Life, he will be saved, no matter what he did, because he accepted Jesus.

	 Every court has a law by which the acts of those who stand for trial are judged. God's law is the standard by which the character and life of men will be measured in judgment.

## Friday


We have seen so far that we need a pure heart to be considered fit for eternal life in the Judgment of Heaven. But, the fact is that today men have an unclean heart. And when they see the evil spread among them, many go so far as to declare like the patriarch Job: ** Who will bring out the pure from the unclean? No one ** {class = verse} ** Job 14: 4 ** {class = book}. But what is impossible with men is possible with God.

c) May God have mercy towards his transgressions.   

!!! note ""
	 In the judgment scene we are studying, from which Daniel saw its beginning in Heaven, the work began to erase the sins of those who sincerely repented and were converted. Judgment begins with the work of cleansing the sanctuary. Both go together. We saw that the 2300 afternoons and mornings ended in 1844, when the work of purification began. So we conclude that on that same date the Investigative Court started.

It is true that it is enough to believe in Jesus for Him to act as our advocate. But it is necessary to understand what the fruits of true belief are in order to avoid false security. A father and a mother who really love their child, will assume it before society. The son does the same with his parents. He confesses to being his son and is not ashamed of them; even though they are poor, he does not deny them in the face of wealthy and influential friends.

Jesus received us as children. And as such, he expects us to confess Him as the father of our eternity, Author of our faith and reason for our hope. If we love and believe in Him, we will certainly recognize our connection with Christ before all the people with whom we relate. And Jesus said: ** everyone who confesses me before men, I will also confess before My Father who is in Heaven ** {class = versoQ} ** Matthew 10:32 ** {class = bookVerse}  

## Saturday

** To meditate and study with the family. **

We are not saved by works, we are saved by faith in what Jesus has done for us and does in us. But we are judged by works that are the consequence, or fruit of faith. Whoever truly believes obeys Jesus. Faith is not just the profession, saying * "I believe" *, but the belief rooted in the heart, which moves man to make Jesus his only hope and to obey whatever He commands. By a faith like this the blind man was told by Jesus to wash his eyes in the pool at Siloam and was healed. He believed the word, obeyed, and God restored him.

God's judgment does not cancel the gospel. It does not change the teaching that we are saved by faith, in it it only verifies who had true faith for salvation, and in it persevered to the end.

** What class of people will enter the kingdom of Heaven? ** {class = question} ** Matthew 7:21 ** {class = bookQ}  
** Not everyone who says to me: Lord, Lord! he will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. ** {class = versoQ} ** Matthew 7:21 ** {class = bookVerse}  

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) The class of those who say: Lord, Lord.   
b) The class of those who do God's will.   
c) The class that believes and does not obey.   

Since the judgment began, in '1844`, the cases of those who have died are passing before God. In 2001, the living began to be judged, Jesus declares that those being sanctified should continue to be sanctified when He finishes His work of Judging. So we need the power of Jesus in our lives to fight and overcome every lack of character in order to be clean before Him at His coming. The Bible says that Jesus comes to seek a pure, ready, perfect and adorned church for His husband, who is Christ. Those in this group follow the Lamb wherever He goes. They were purchased as first fruits for God and for the Lamb. And no mistake was found in his mouth; because they are blameless before the throne of God. Amen!

# (7) The Second Angel's Message

!!! quote Back Ground
    Another angel followed, the second, saying: The great Babylon has fallen, has fallen, which has made all the nations drink from the wine of the wrath of her prostitution. ** Revelation 14: 6,7 ** {class = book}

## Sunday

An angel followed the first to send a message to all the inhabitants of the Earth. This shows us that the message that this second angel brings is in addition to the first message. To understand the message of the second angel, it is necessary to have understood and accepted the message of the first angel. We can compare the messages to stages to be won in a race before proceeding.

Several important points were seen and that we need to keep in mind: The judgment in Heaven is underway, and we need to prepare for it, because all of us, who accept Jesus as our Savior and Lord, will be judged; God expects us to recognize that He is the only true God, worthy of worship and no other else.

When we look at the Christian world today, we face the acceptance and acceptance of many doctrines that do not find the biblical support for their acceptance and education. It is even the Protestants who, in principle, defended the purity of biblical doctrines, today reject many fundamental doctrines defended by the Bible. In this study of the Bible we will study some of them and the way in which Cielo, Dios and His Jesus are dishonored by this confusion.

## Monday

Babylon comes from the term Babel, which means confusion. In Genesis, the first to get rid of the Bible, we have an account of someone who sought to guide the people to act in direct opposition to God. God had told Noah and his sons to spread out and fill the earth; however Nimrod, whose name means * "rebel" *. Or he rebelled, knowing the will of God, tried to build several cities, where the people could live together. In the first city he built, Nimrod sought to build a monument that would be the greatest example of defying the orders of the God of Heaven.

This monument, however, was never completed because when observing the Lord what men did, he frustrated his intent, confusing the language of those who built the tower that became known in history, as the Tower of Babel, because there God confused the language of the whole earth, and from there the Lord scattered them on the face of the whole earth. ** Genesis 11: 3-9 ** {class = book}

## Tuesday

In the book of Revelation, God reveals that, although the city of Babylon should never be built again, a false religious system, along the lines of the ancient city, would rise and fulfill a similar role in modern times. And so that no one would be deceived by this system and lead to the destruction that awaits him, he revealed characteristics, through symbols that allow him to be identified.

## Thursday

There are two cups presented in the Word of God: the cup of the Lord and the cup of Babylon. The wine in the Lord's cup represents the living truth, "as the truth is in Jesus"; the wine in the cup of Babylon represents his false doctrines, the replacement of the living Word and law of God by human tradition, and the illicit union he made between the church and secular (political) power, to give strength to his teaching.

For this very reason, while maintaining a form of piety, it nevertheless denies its effectiveness. The substitution of the law of God for the law of the church, in fulfillment of the prophecy of ** Daniel 7:25, ** {class = book} testifies to the complete subordination of the Word of God to the authority of the church.

The universal teaching of these doctrines instead of the pure gospel, led the world astray and caused all nations to drink the wine of the wrath of their prostitution. The sixteenth-century reform was an effort to return to the pure truths of God's Word. In this the reformers denied supremacy of the tradition over the Holy Scriptures.

** What relationship does the Church of Rome have with other apostate churches? ** {class = question} ** Revelation 17: 5 ** {class = bookQ}

When Protestant churches repudiated the fundamental principle of Protestantism, setting aside the authority of the Bible, accepting human tradition and speculation in their place, they adopted the fundamental principle of modern Babylon, and may be called daughters of Babylon. Its fall is then included in that of Babylon, and requires a proclamation of the fall of modern Babylon.

Many representatives of modern Protestantism have rejected, in one way or another, many fundamental doctrines of the Bible, such as:

1. Creation in literal ideas
1. The fall of man
1. The biblical doctrine of sin
1. The infallibility of the Scriptures
1. The perfection of Scripture as a rule of faith and practice
1. What is the divinity of Christ affirmed in the Bible
1. Christ's resurrection
1. Jesus' death, his atonement in our place
1. Salvation by grace
1. God's law
1. The Sabbath of Creation
1. One God the Father
1. Mortality of the soul, and others, etc.


!!! note ""
	 Although the leaders of modern Protestantism have not officially adopted the creed of the Church of Rome, and are not an organic part of this corporation, they still belong to the same class in rejecting the authority of the Word of God, accepting instead the product of their own arguments. There is as much apostasy in one case as in the other, and both must therefore be included in Babylon, and both will find themselves involved, after all, in its downfall.

e) () Because when he presents the reasons for the fall, the people of God invite him to leave.   

!!! note ""
	 The prophecy presents this fall in two instances since the first church to fall into the divine concept was the Catholic Church, as already in 325 AD, the introduction of false doctrines by this church began. And the repetition of the term * "fell" * presents a time in the future (time we are living in today) when the churches in general, by accepting these false doctrines, would be invalidating the commandments of God and consequently becoming participants in the sins of the church mom.

# (8) The Third Angel's Message

!!! quote Back Ground
    These were followed by another angel, the third, saying in a loud voice: If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives its mark on the forehead or on the hand ... ** Revelation 14: 9-12 ** {class = book}

## Sunday

A third angel followed them ... Also the third angel's message is part of or completes the previous messages given by the first and second angels. The messages of the first, second and third angels form a whole; an everlasting gospel to be proclaimed in the final moment of earth's history, before Jesus returns here to seek His church. So accepting the gospel of Heaven means accepting the final message brought by the three angels. There is no way to accept one and reject another. It is a progressive experience.

Whoever accepts the message of the first angel: * "the hour of His judgment has come" *, seeks to fear God, which is to keep His commandments. In fact, if you are aware that the fallen religious corporations are in error, and in order to obey the gospel that you have received, they will have to break their connection with them.

So the second angel's recommendation will be fulfilling: * "Babylon has fallen, fallen!" *. * "My church fell" * - he says. For this example, we see that the experience of those who understood and answered the message of the first angel will lead to understand and respond to the message of the second angel.

But if you don't see light in the first message, you won't see how and why to answer the second angel's message too. We can compare the messages to a three-step ladder. It is necessary to go up one at a time.

** How can we compare the message of the three angels given by the prophecies of Revelation? ** {class = question} ** II Peter1: 19 ** {class = bookQ}  
** And we have, very firmly, the word of the prophets, which you do well to be attentive to, like a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawns, and the star of the dawn appears in your hearts. ** { class = versoQ} ** II Peter 1:19 ** {class = bookVerse}  

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) We can compare it to a path that is narrowing more and more.   
b) We can compare it to a light that shines more and more until daylight.   
c) We can compare it to a very bright star.   

** Does the third angel's message make a solemn warning against which apostasy? ** {class = question} ** Revelation 14: 9 ** {class = bookQ}  
** And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice: If anyone worships the beast, and his image, and receives the mark on his forehead, or in his hand, ** {class = versoQ} ** Revelation 14 : 9 ** {class = bookVerse}  

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) The third angel's message warns against image worship.   
b) It is a solemn warning against worshiping the beast, its image and its brand.   
c) The third angel's message warns against worshiping trademarks and patents.   

!!! note ""
	 The third angel's message is the last part of the gospel sent to the world. The word gospel means good news. The third angel is in charge of presenting the final part of the good news of Heaven sent to the world. It is like the last chapter of a book. It presents the outcome of everything and the solution of the drama. It announces what will be the end of those who reject the good news of the gospel, and it gives the characteristic that those who accept warnings and good news have in the end time.

** What will be the characteristic of those who obey and accept the eternal gospel given by the three angels? ** {class = question} ** Revelation 14:12 ** {class = bookQ}  
** Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and faith in Jesus. ** {class = versoQ} ** Revelation 14:12 ** {class = bookVerse}  

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) They keep the commandments of God and have the faith of Jesus.   
b) They keep the commandments but have no faith in Jesus.

** I saw another great and admirable sign in heaven: seven angels having the last seven scourges, because with them God's wrath was consumed. ** {class = versoQ} ** Revelation 15: 1 ** {class = bookVerse}  
a) The wine of God's wrath is a tsunami that will fall on the earth.   
b) The wine of God's wrath will be a sign in the great and wonderful sky.   
c) The wine of God's wrath will, in the end, be the last seven plagues as a result of the choice they made. By making this choice, you will be losing divine protection.   

!!! note ""
	 How can a message that announces the outpouring of the wrath of God, the lake of fire and the destruction of the wicked be good news. The answer is simple. Depends on the viewpoint. Viewed by the eyes of the world, it may seem like a threat of punishment. But, from a divine point of view, it is a right sign in the right place. It is like the vision plates next to the high voltage wires that say: <br/> `DO NOT EXCEED, DANGER OF DEATH. <br/> Nobody, when facing these warning signs, curse the technicians for putting them there , Is not it? Before we were satisfied and grateful for the care with us. Your message saves our lives! Although it announces death for those who disobey it, for those who answer its message, the sign saves life. So there is good news, the right message given at the right time. This is what happens with the third angel's message; it announces to the beast worshipers that if they worship the beast and its image and receive its mark they will be killed.

** What description is made of the Beast? ** {class = question} ** Revelation 13: 1,2; Revelation 17: 3 ** {class = bookQ}
** I saw a beast emerge from the sea that had ten horns and seven heads and, on the horns, ten diadems and, on the heads, names of blasphemy. ** {class = versoQ} ** Revelation 13: 1,2 ** {class = bookVerse}  
** The angel transported me, in spirit, to a desert and I saw a woman astride a scarlet beast, a beast full of names of blasphemy, with seven heads and ten horns. ** {class = versoQ} ** Revelation 17: 3 ** {class = bookVerse}  

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) The beast is an animal with seven heads and ten horns.   
b) The beast is a headless animal.   
c) The beast is an animal with ten heads and seven horns.   

** What does animal in prophecy represent in the Bible? ** {class = question} ** Daniel 7: 17,23 ** {class = bookQ}  
** These great animals, which are four, are four kings, who will rise from the earth. ** {class = versoQ} ** Daniel 7:17 ** {class = bookVerse}

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) Animal represents a creature of God.   
b) Animal represents kingdom or king.   
c) I don't know.   

!!! note ""
	 Animal in the Bible means * "kingdom" * or * "king" * ** (Daniel 7: 17,23). ** {class = book} The woman (Catholic Church) is mounted in this kingdom, that is, she rules over it . The kingdom over which the Catholic Church rules is the Vatican. In Revelation we find some characteristics that allow us to identify it. If she is worshiped, it is a religious power. He was allowed to make war on the saints, and to overcome them ** (Revelation 13: 5). ** {class = book} Hence we understand that he is a persecuting power of the saints of God. And authority was given him over all the tribe and people and language and nation. ** Revelation 13: 7 ** {class = book}. The beast had authority over kings. Only one power fulfills all the characteristics described here; the medieval papacy. It was a religious power that persecuted and killed the saints, whom it called * "heretics" *, and had authority over kings. The Pope has on his tiara the inscription: 'VICARIVS FILII DEI`, which means Vicar, or substitute for the Son of God. He claims to be the divine representative on earth. But he orders to kill those who do not accept his doctrines. This is not how Christ proceeded; on the contrary, he gave his life for those who rejected him.
The third angel's message shows that the part of those who worship the beast or associate with it will be to suffer the wrath of God and be destroyed in the lake of fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. The beast goes to perdition. The third angel's message gives a warning to all sincere people not to follow and share their lot. It gives us the opportunity to change paths. And so, we can break any connection with it and save our soul.

** What do the people who worship the beast say, whose names are not written in the book of life? ** {class = question} ** Revelation 13: 4 ** {class = bookQ}  
** And they worshiped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast; they also worshiped the beast, saying, Who is like the beast? Who can fight against it? ** {class = versoQ} ** Revelation 13: 4 ** {class = bookVerse}  

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) People are frightened by the beast and want to escape from it.   
b) People are amazed at the appearance of the beast and * say "who is like the beast, who can fight against it". *   
c) People speak ill of the beast, after all it is a beast.

	 The Bible declares that those who worship the beast are actually worshiping the dragon that gave the beast power and authority.

** Who is the dragon that gave power and authority to the beast? ** {class = question} ** Revelation 12: 9 ** {class = bookQ}  
** And the great dragon, the ancient serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, who deceives the whole world, was precipitated; he was precipitated on the earth, and his angels were cast with him. ** {class = versoQ} ** Revelation 12: 9 ** {class = bookVerse}  

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) The dragon is a desert animal.   
b) The dragon is the devil and Satan.   
c) The dragon is a legendary figure, who only appears in fables.   

!!! note ""
	 It may seem strange that the Word of God refers to a religious system directed by the power of Satan and that the vast majority of those who claim to be Christians, even though they are sincere, are worshiping and worshiping the enemy, but Jesus himself affirmed that his god century is Satan himself.

## Wednesday

The message warns of worshiping the beast as well as its image. The image is not the person, but a faithful copy of him. In the spiritual sense, God says that the beast has an image. A power that is a faithful copy of the power called * "beast" *, but that is not exactly the beast. We have already seen from history that the beast is the papacy. We have also seen that this beast symbol represents the union of religious power with the government in order to be able to persecute and kill the saints. The union of * "religious" * power with * "civil" * power characterizes what the Bible calls the beast.

The image of the beast is not itself, but a copy of it. It must therefore represent the union of religious and civil power, to persecute and kill the saints. It is not difficult to see who the image of the beast represents. In the same way that the Catholic Church in the past made agreements with the government to obtain advantages, today we see Protestant and Evangelical churches act in the same way. Through the ecumenical movement, Catholics and Protestants are uniting in one body, seeking to achieve the same goals.

As the image of the beast is a faithful copy of the church / state union that characterized the papacy in the past, it is today the union of Protestant and evangelical churches with the state.
''
Beast = union of the papal church with the governments of the Earth. 
Image of the beast = union of the Protestant churches with the governments of Earth.

b) They will also drink the wine of God's wrath.   
c) They will be like the beast.   

!!! note ""
	 God warns us today not to follow the path of corrupt and fallen churches. The message says not to worship the beast and its image. Can we be sure that we are not worshiping or worshiping the beast? The word worship in the Bible is related to worship. The apostle Paul warns us that worship is to present sacrifices to God and tells us what sacrifice we must offer.

** How should our worship or rational service be? ** {class = question} ** Romans 12: 1 ** {class = bookQ}  
** I therefore beseech you, brethren, by the compassion of God, that you present your bodies in a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God, which is your rational worship. ** {class = versoQ} ** Romans 12: 1 ** {class = bookVerse}

b) To worship is to like someone very much.

    Worshiping the beast and its image is related to accepting the worship that the churches promote.

	 The cup of God, which contains the new covenant in the blood of Jesus, and the cup of the wine of Babylon's wrath are both offered to the world. To drink from the first, that is to accept the teaching of the true gospel, is to receive eternal life, but to drink the wine of Babylon, that is, to accept the false gospel taught by the papacy, will result in drinking the wine of the wrath of God, of the cup of His indignation. The true gospel means eternal life; the false gospel means eternal death.

God has given us His holy precepts because He loves humanity. To shield us from the results of transgression, he reveals the principles of justice.

## Monday

When the law was proclaimed from Sinai, God made known the holiness of His character so that, by contrast, they could see their own sinfulness. The law was given to convict sin, and to reveal to them their need for a savior. It would do so, as its principles were applied in the heart by the Holy Spirit.

This work she must do yet. In the life of Christ the principles of the law become evident; and, by touching the Holy Spirit of God in the heart, in revealing the light of Christ to men the need they have for His cleansing blood and His justifying justice, the law is still an instrument in bringing us to Christ to be justified by faith . * "The law of the Lord is perfect, and restores the soul". *

** Why should we be holy and perfect? ​​** {class = question} ** Matthew 5:48; Leviticus 19: 2 ** {class = bookQ}  
** Therefore, be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect. ** {class = versoQ} ** Matthew 5:48 ** {class = bookVerse}  
** Speak to the whole congregation of the children of Israel and say to them, 'You will be holy, because I, the Lord your God, am holy. ** {class = versoQ} ** Leviticus 19: 2 ** {class = bookVerse }  

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) It is impossible to be holy here on earth, holy only in heaven.   
b) The word * "holy" * means "set apart for a sacred purpose". God wants us to be separated from this world and live on a level and obedience to His will.   
c) When we die and go to heaven, we will be holy and intercede with the Father like the Virgin Mary does.   

** How will we be perfect before God? ** {class = question} ** Genesis 17: 1; 5: 22-24 ** {class = bookQ}  
** When Abram reached the age of ninety-nine years, the Lord appeared to him and said to him: I am the Almighty God; walk in my presence and be perfect. ** {class = versoQ} ** Genesis 17: 1 ** {class = bookVerse}  
** Enoch walked with God ... and he was no longer, because God took him for himself. ** {class = versoQ} ** Genesis 5: 22-24 ** {class = bookVerse}  

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) To be perfect before God, just offer in the church and God does the rest.   
b) To be perfect, we need to give ourselves daily to the Lord. To walk in the presence of God is to choose to serve Him in every moment and attitude of life.   
c) It cannot be perfect, it is impossible.   

** What was the law given for? ** {class = question} ** Romans 3:20; 7: 7 ** {class = bookQ}  
** Since no one will be justified before him by works of the law, because by the law comes full knowledge of sin. ** {class = versoQ} ** Romans 3:20 ** {class = bookVerse}  
** What shall we say then? Is the law a sin? Not at all! But I would not have known sin, except through the law; for I would not have known greed if the law had not said: Thou shalt not covet. ** {class = versoQ} ** Romans 7: 7 ** {class = bookVerse}

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) The Law of God reveals to us what sin is. It is the ideal divine standard for holiness.   
b) The law was given only to ancient Israel, it is not valid for us.   
c) The law was abolished on the cross.   

** Can we please God by living according to our own will? ** {class = question} ** Romans 8: 7,8 ** {class = bookQ}  
** Therefore, the inclination of the flesh is enmity against God, because it is not subject to the law of God, nor can it even be. Therefore, those who are in the flesh cannot please God. ** {class = versoQ} ** Romans 8: 7,8 ** {class = bookVerse}  

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) Yes, just accept Jesus as your Savior and you are saved.   
b) Yes, once saved, always saved.   
c) No, because we are carnal and sinners, our nature is contrary to the divine nature that is holy. We are not, by nature, inclined to obedience. We need an outside (external) power, which we don't have, to make us keepers of the Law.

    You therefore speak to the children of Israel, saying, Surely you will keep my Sabbaths; because that is a sign between me and you in your generations; so that you may know that I am the Lord, who sanctifies you ** Exodus 31:13 ** {class = book}

## Sunday

When we read in the book of Revelation 14:11, in the message given by the third angel; we observe that those who worship the beast and its image and even those who receive the sign of its name have no rest or rest. Hence, we can say that there is a rest or rest in the Scriptures prepared for the people of God and that the wicked will never have.

We know that the wicked are the ones who reject God, the rest that they do not have must be the rest that God offers. 

The apostle Paul wrote in Hebrews: ** There remains a Sabbath rest for God's people; for in a certain place He said thus of the seventh day: And God rested, on the seventh day, from all His works; For he who entered into the rest of God, he also rested from his works, as well as God from His ** {class = verse} ** Hebrews 4: 9,4,10 ** {class = book}.

	 In the past, a king sealed his laws with his ring that contained its three attributes. The first was his name, the second his position and the third his territorial competence. When people saw that seal they already recognized the king who made that law. The Sabbath day is the seal of God, it has its name (God), its position (Creator) and its jurisdiction or territorial competence (The heavens and the earth). That is why the Sabbath is considered the seal of God.

The Sabbath reform work to be carried out in recent times is foretold in Isaiah's prophecy: ** "Thus says the Lord: Keep your judgment, and do justice, for my salvation is about to come, and mine righteousness to manifest. Blessed is the man who does this, and the son of man who makes use of it; who keeps himself from profaning the Sabbath, and keeps his hand from doing any evil. "** {class = verse} ** Isaiah 56: 1,2 ** {class = book}. ** "To the children of foreigners who come to the Lord to serve Him, and to love the Lord's name, thus being His servants, all who keep the Sabbath, not profaning it, and those who embrace My covenant, too I will take you to My holy mountain, and I will celebrate you in My house of prayer. "** {class = verse} ** Isaiah 56: 6,7 ** {class = book}.

# (12) Mortality of the Soul

!!! quote Back Ground
    Know that he who converts the sinner to the wrong way will save his soul from death and cover a multitude of sins. ** James 5:20 ** {class = book}

## Sunday

We often wonder about what happens after death. We see many theories being said and preached, and it often seems difficult to discern between what is truth and what is false. Our security is to seek that truth in the Bible - the Word of God. This subject about death is little studied in the Christian milieu, however, we need to understand it in depth, because within this theme we find the first lie preached by Satan on this Earth, and on this theme the enemy of souls concentrates one of his last mistakes in the days leading up to Jesus' coming to this earth to seek his own.

Early in human history, Satan began his efforts to deceive our race. He who had incited rebellion in Heaven wished to lead the inhabitants of the Earth to unite with him in a fight against the government of God.

Adam and Eve had been perfectly happy in obedience to divine law, and this fact was a constant testimony to the claim that Satan had insisted in heaven, that God's law was oppressive, and was opposed to the welfare of His creatures. It also aroused the envy of this enemy when he looked at the beautiful home prepared for the innocent couple. It was decided to cause his fall, so that, having separated himself from God and brought under his power, he could obtain possession of the Earth, and here establish his kingdom in opposition to the Most High.

** How did God create man? ** {class = question} ** Genesis 2: 7 ** {class = bookQ}  
** Then the Lord God formed man from the dust of the earth and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul. ** {class = versoQ} ** Genesis 2: 7 ** {class = bookVerse}  

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) God spoke and the man appeared.   
b) Through the monkeys   
c) God formed man through the union of the dust of the earth + the breath of life = living soul.   

!!! note ""
	 Note that the text does not say that man * "HAS" * a soul, but that he "IS" a living soul. A soul is formed by the union of the body (dust of the earth) with the breath of life. See how is the equation that forms the soul: `POWDER OF EARTH (BODY) + FOLEGO DE VIDA = LIVING SOUL`

Therefore, to say that we have a soul is wrong, as we are a soul as long as the breath of God remains in us.

** Did God make man to die or to live forever? ** {class = question} ** Genesis 2: 16,17 ** {class = bookQ}  
** And the Lord God gave him this command: You shall eat freely from every tree in the garden, but you shall not eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil; because the day you eat of it, you will surely die. ** {class = versoQ} ** Genesis 2: 16,17 ** {class = bookVerse}  

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) God made man to live forever, with the condition of obedience, if he disobeyed the consequence would be death.   
b) God made man to live forever without any conditions.   
c) God created man to be a mortal being, that is, to die someday.   

!!! note ""
	 God had created man to live forever in happiness, but there was one condition: perfect obedience. In disobeying, the sure consequence would be death.

## Monday

Had Satan manifested himself in his true character, he would have been promptly repelled. However, he operated in the darkness, hiding his purpose, so that he could more effectively accomplish his goal. Employing the serpent, then a creature of fascinating aspect, as an intermediary, he addressed Eva ...

** Tick the correct answer: **  
a) The snake told the woman that she would always be beautiful.   
b) The snake told the woman that if she disobeyed she would not die.   
c) The snake did not say anything to the woman because the snake does not speak.   

!!! note ""
	 If Eva had avoided arguing with the tempter, she would have been safe; but she risked talking to him, and fell victim to his mistakes. That is how many are still defeated. They doubt and argue about God's precepts; and, instead of obeying divine commands, they accept human theories, which only disguise Satan's traps. The first sermon preached by Satan (the serpent) was that man would be immortal even in disobedience. He wanted to lead us from the beginning to believe in immortality in a life of sin.

## Wednesday

The serpent declared to Eve that they would become like God, possessing greater wisdom than before, and being capable of a higher condition of existence. Eve gave in to temptation; and, by his influence, Adam was led to sin. They accepted the serpent's words, that God did not mean what he had said; they distrusted their Creator, and imagined that He was restricting their freedom, and that they could obtain great wisdom and exultation, for transgressing His law.

But how did Adam understand after his sin, the meaning of the words: * "The day you eat of it, you will surely die"? * Did you think that they meant, as Satan had led him to believe, that he should be brought into a higher condition? of existence? In that case, there would, in fact, be great good to be gained by the transgression, and Satan would prove to be a benefactor of the race. But Adam did not think this was the meaning of the divine sentence. God declared that, as a penalty for his sin, man would return to the land from which he was taken: ** "You are dust, and in dust you will become" ** {class = verse} ** (Genesis 3:19). ** { class = book} Satan's words: * "... your eyes will be opened", * {class = verse} were true only in this sense: After Adam and Eve disobeyed God, their eyes were opened to discern its madness;

Immortality, promised to man on condition of obedience, was lost by transgression ... The only one who promised Adam life in disobedience was the great deceiver. And the serpent's declaration to Eve, in Eden - ** "You will certainly not die" ** {class = verse} - was the first sermon preached about the immortality of the soul. However, this statement, resting only on the authority of Satan, echoes from the pulpits of Christendom, and is received by most of humanity as easily as it was by our first parents.

Satan has the power to transfigure himself to deceive people. So with him he used the serpent to talk to Eve and deceive her in the garden of Eden, today, he pretends to be deceased relatives or friends with manifestations that are nothing more than the action of Satan himself and his evil sign-working angels to try to help us. trick.

!!! note ""
	 After the fall, Satan ordered his angels to make a special effort to inculcate the belief in immortality inherent in man; and, having induced the people to receive this error, they should lead them to conclude that the sinner would live in a state of eternal misery. Now the prince of darkness, operating through his agents, represents God as a vengeful tyrant, declaring that He plunges into hell everyone who does not please him, and makes him always feel His wrath; and that, while suffering unspeakable anguish, and writhing in the eternal flames, Their Creator looks upon them with satisfaction.
Thus the prince of demons invests with his own attributes the Creator and Benefactor of humanity. Cruelty is satanic. God is love: and everything he created was pure, holy and beautiful, until sin was introduced by the first great rebel.

## Sunday

The relationship of the visible world to the invisible world, the ministry of the angels of God and the operation of evil spirits, are clearly revealed in Scripture, and inseparably mixed with human history. There is an increasing tendency not to believe in the existence of evil spirits, while the holy angels who ** "minister for those who will inherit salvation" ** {class = verse} ** (Hebrews 1:14), ** {class = book} are considered by many to be the spirits of the dead.

Before the creation of man, angels existed, for when the foundations of the earth were laid, ** the morning stars sang praises and all the children of God rejoiced ** {class = verse} ** Job: 38: 7 * * {class = book}. After the fall of man, angels were sent to guard the tree of life, and this, before any human being had died. Angels are superior to man in nature, for the psalmist says that man was made ** slightly less than angels ** {class = verse} ** (Psalm 8: 5) ** {class = book}.

The doctrine of man's conscience in death, especially the belief that the spirits of the dead return to minister to the living, paved the way for modern spiritualism.

## Monday


The very name of witchcraft is now held in contempt. The claim that men can maintain communication with evil spirits is considered a fable of the Dark Ages. But Spiritism, which has hundreds of thousands, yes, millions, which has opened its way in scientific circles, invaded churches, and found favor in legislative bodies and even in the courts of kings - this colossal mistake is nothing more than a revival, in a new guise, from the condemned and forbidden witchcraft of the past.

Modern popular theologians teach that the dead are admitted into the presence of God and holy angels and are favored with knowledge that far exceeds what they previously had. And, as they are hovering over their friends on Earth, why would they not be allowed to communicate with him in order to warn them against evil, or to comfort them in sadness? And how can those who believe in the conscious state of the dead, reject what comes to them as divine light transmitted by glorified spirits?

Thus the enemy has an effective means of communication, considered sacred to accomplish his purposes. The fallen angels who carry out his orders appear as messengers from the spirit world. While professing to bring the living in communication with the dead, the evil prince exerts a fascinating influence on them.

## Wednesday

If there were no other evidence of the real character of Spiritism, it should be enough for the Christian that spirits make no difference between justice and sin, between the most noble and pure of Christ's apostles and the most corrupt of Satan's servants. Representing the meanest men as being in Heaven, being highly exalted there, Satan says to the world: No matter how wicked you are, it does not matter whether or not you believe in God and the Bible. Live as you wish; Heaven is your home.

Satan has the power to make the appearance of his deceased friends appear before men.

## Friday

Often, would-be visitors from the spirit world give warnings and warnings that prove to be correct. Then, when they gain confidence, they present doctrines that directly undermine faith in the Scriptures. With the appearance of a deep interest in the welfare of their friends on Earth, they hint at the most dangerous mistakes.

The fact that they declare certain truths and can sometimes predict future events, gives their statements an appearance of credit; and their false teachings are so readily accepted by the multitudes, and so implicitly believed, as if they were the most sacred truths in the Bible.

The law is set aside, the Spirit of grace despised, the blood of the covenant taken into account for profane things. Spirits deny the divinity of Christ, placing the Creator himself on the same level as they are. So in new disguise, the great rebel still continues with the struggle against God-struggle that began in Heaven, and continued for almost six thousand years on Earth.

## Saturday

** To meditate and study with the family! **

Many endeavor to explain the spiritist manifestations, attributing them entirely to fraud by the medium. But while it is true that the results of cheating have often been presented as genuine manifestations, there have also been marked displays of supernatural power. The mysterious strokes with which modern spiritualism began, were not the result of cheating the human artifice, but the direct work of the evil angels, who thus introduced a most effective deception for the destruction of souls. Many are led to believe that the manifestations that they believed to be a lie are the manifestation of the power of God when they verify that it is not a human imposture. We must remember, however, that the devil also has the power to even fire down from heaven.

It is true that spiritism in its current form takes on a Christian appearance, declaring to accept Christ and Holy Scripture, but the Bible is interpreted in a way that pleases the unregenerate heart, while its solemn and vital truths are nullified. It is concerned with love as being the main attribute of God, lowering it, however, until it reduces it to sentimentality, making little distinction between good and evil. God's righteousness, His reprobation of sin, the requirements of His holy law, these are all set aside. The people are taught to consider the decalogue as a dead letter, Pleasing and fascinating fables, captivate the senses, leading men to reject the Holy Scriptures as the foundation of faith. Christ is as truly denied as before; but Satan has so blinded the people that deception cannot be discerned.

Many venture out of curiosity to put it under their influence. He has no intention of believing or accepting these spirit teachings. They enter, however, on forbidden ground and the powerful destroyer exerts his force on them against his will. Once induced to submit the mind to its direction, it holds them captive. It is impossible by their own strength to break with the fascinating, alluring charm. Nothing but the power of God, granted in response to the fervent prayer of faith, will be able to deliver these captive souls.
